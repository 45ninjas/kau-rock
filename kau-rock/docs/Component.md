# Component

At the time of development and scope of this project a component system makes sense to me. An Entity Component System is a little complicated for the small scope for this project. Therefore, the components in kau-rock, like with Unity's MonoBehavours both store data and logic. This is not ideal for large projects, luckily this engine is not ideal for large projects too.
